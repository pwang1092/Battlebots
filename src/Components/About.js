                We are a group of enthusiastic undergraduate engineering students that creates and destroys robots!
                Our goal is to gain hands-on experience in engineering through designing, building, competing, and fixing combat robots.
                Working together, the team build a remote-controlled robot to compete in an arena styled tournament against other bots.

                            and mechanical physics of how robots interact with others. At the end of each semester, the team aims to compete at the National Havoc Robot League in an arena styled tournament.</p>
